# Rerouted systemutvikler.net
(work in progress)

This site is written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and is hosted on github. My plan is to collect my work in one place and make my breadcrumb trail on internet more transparent. Right now I use different aliases which can't be traced back to me as a person. This is how things worked in the good old days, before the event of social media. Now it is all about "look at me" and numeric overflow when you do a "select count(\*) from profile.Contcts". 

What ppl don't know is the massive amount of information corporates and hackers harvest from the internet about you as a person. They can predict your next move by analysing search history and postings on social media. Suddenly you have become a target of a fraud, and you don't know why? Probably because you have made yourself a target by leaving sensitive information open on the net. Years of accumulated information may also be used when you apply for a new job. The employer may acquire massaged information from "harvesters" and use it to make sure you're a good fit with the rest of the team. Nice!

Enough rambling. For the time being just ignore what you have read. SiteStatus=WorkInProgress
